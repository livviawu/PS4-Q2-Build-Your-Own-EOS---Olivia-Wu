# PS4-Q2-Build-Your-Own-EOS---Olivia-Wu

I decided to split this problem's files into two files.

PS4Q2 : File for computing values and plotting graphs

I had to revert to an older version of scipy. Scipy version 1.16.0 wasn't allowing me to resolve any of the computations I needed using the scipy.differentiate derivative function. The version I reverted to is scipy version 1.13.0 with scipy.misc derivative function

PS4Q2Funcs : Functions I made and used to complete the computations and plotting
